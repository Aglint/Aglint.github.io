<h1 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h1><p>&emsp;Higher education is an important stage of education for a country to cultivate talents who can serve the society. However, so far, there is no unified model to scientifically and effectively measure whether a country’s higher education system is healthy and sustainable. This paper constructs an effective model to evaluate the higher education system of any country and formulates new policies for low-evaluation countries.Meanwhile, we reasonably predict the future development prospects of higher education.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>In Task 1,</b>we established a higher education investment model and Talent Cultivation Quality Evaluation Model based on the most common influencing factors. And in order to eliminate the gap between developed and developing regions, we constructed the Service Quality Evaluation model.After that, the factor analysis method is used to clarify the influence of the three sub-models to the final comprehensive evaluation score. According to the model, the United States, China, and Japan were evaluated. The results show that China is the worst among them and its score is only 33.7% of the United States and Japan. It proves that it has a lot of room for improvement. Therefore, we choose China as our further research object.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>In Task 2,</b>according to the real situation of China, we propose some beautiful visions for it from three aspects: Economic inputEducational process and Teaching system. For the purpose of achieving them, we have formulated a three-step strategy to increase the enrollment rate of higher education, and require the government to provide more than 1.5% of GDP for higher education through funding, fundraising and other methods. In addition, the status and salary of educators should also an increase of more than 5% .</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>In Task 3,</b>we use our model to measure and compare the health of both the current system and the proposed. It indicated that the comprehensive evaluation score of the Chinese model increased by about 187%, especially the contribution score of the talent evaluation model reached 2.32 times the original. Then we utilize the CIPP evaluation method. By classifying the four evaluation directions into three levels of indicators, we have more strictly proved the scientific rationality and operability of our policies.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>In Task 4,</b>discussing the real-world impacts of implementing your plan means we need to further analyse the effect of the policies and forecast the condition in the future. For education system, we forecast the demographic changes at different levels of education in China with the help of the ISSA model. the conclusion is that after the implementation of the new adjustment, the number of people in higher education is 1.2 times the original natural change, and the number of people without education is reduced to about 18%.For society and the country, our policy has stimulated progress in backward areas. This helps alleviate Chinas uneven development.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>Finally,</b> we conduct a sensitivity analysis of our model and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our model. </p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><h2 id="Problem-Background"><a href="#Problem-Background" class="headerlink" title="Problem Background"></a>Problem Background</h2><p>&emsp;Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, the social demand for specialized talents is rapidly increased.At the same time, the rise of the overall cultural level of citizens is also imminent, which is conducive to the development of the country.Higher education is the further professional and vocational education for students on the basis of the completion of secondary education.We can try to meet both of these needs through this activity.</p>
<p>&emsp;Up to now, there are 233 countries and regions in the world with different education systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.It is very important to have a healthy and sustainable state for a country or region’s higher education.Therefore, it is necessary to build a model to measure and evaluate whether a higher education system is healthy and sustainable.This model will enable the country to better formulate relevant policies to make improvements, so as to achieve its own continuous development.</p>
<h2 id="Our-work"><a href="#Our-work" class="headerlink" title="Our work"></a>Our work</h2><ol>
<li><p>Firstly, we establish an evaluation model of the health status about higher education which is applicable to all countries and apply it to several countries for analysis and select a country where there is room for improvement in its higher education system. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Then we develop an attainable and reasonable vision for the selected country.we propose target policies and implementation timelines to support migration from the current state to the proposed state. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Furthermore,we use our model to measure current and improved systems in selected countries.And evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed policies. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Last but not least, we discuss the impact of the policy on the real world during the transition and final stages of the implementation phase. </p>

&emsp;In order to solve the first problem,We build the higher education health evaluation model based on factor analysis.The following is our specific operation :

<ul>
<li>Analyze the economic investment of various countries in higher education.</li>
<li>Establish a talent quality evaluation model.</li>
<li>Use gap analysis to discuss citizens’ satisfaction with the national higher education system and improve results .</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Economic-Investment"><a href="#Economic-Investment" class="headerlink" title="Economic Investment"></a>Economic Investment</h2><p>&emsp;By studying a country’s investment in higher education, we can see how much the country attaches importance to higher education.The higher a country’s emphasis on higher education, the healthier its education system is likely to be.<br>&emsp;Therefore, we collected the percentages of higher education expenditures and fiscal education expenditures to GDP in many countries in the past five years.This helps us to research. </p>
<h3 id="Economic-Input-Analysis-Model"><a href="#Economic-Input-Analysis-Model" class="headerlink" title="Economic Input Analysis Model"></a>Economic Input Analysis Model</h3><p>&emsp;Next we will study the following two important factors and their relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher education investment as a percentage of GDP</li>
<li>Proportion of higher education investment in education investment</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;We set the ratio of higher education and fiscal education expenditure to GDP as 𝛼 and 𝛽 respectively. To calculate the proportion of higher education in all education expenditures, we divide 𝛼 by 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎. The result is 𝛾,which is what we need.Since the datas all we used are percentages, it is not easy to process and determine the result. And after analyzing the data we collected,we found that the closer 𝛾 is to 0.3, the more stable the 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 is.And 𝛼 is positively related to 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥. To simplify processing,we took the operation of multiplying 𝛼 and 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 by 10. The calculation formula we obtained is<br>$$<br>Index = 10 × (10 × \alpha − |0.3 − \gamma|)<br>$$</p>
<h2 id="Talent-Cultivation-Quality-Evaluation-Model"><a href="#Talent-Cultivation-Quality-Evaluation-Model" class="headerlink" title="Talent Cultivation Quality Evaluation Model"></a>Talent Cultivation Quality Evaluation Model</h2><h3 id="Establishment-Process"><a href="#Establishment-Process" class="headerlink" title="Establishment Process"></a>Establishment Process</h3><p>&emsp;An important indicator to evaluate the health of a higher education system is the quality of talent training.And the quality of talent cultivation can be measured from three aspects:knowledge, ability and quality.<br>&emsp;As we all know, knowledge can be acquired through hard study. The prerequisite for capacity improvement is the accumulation of a large amount of knowledge and the improvement of knowledge structure. The cultivation and improvement of quality can only be acquired through the accumulation of a lot of time studying.Then, from the perspective of view of mathematics, ability is the function of knowledge, quality is the function of knowledge and ability, and talent quality is the function of knowledge, ability and quality.<br>&emsp;Therefore, the evaluation model of talent cultivation quality in higher education can be constructed as follows:<br>$$<br>𝑄 = 𝐴𝐾^𝑛 = (A_0 + 𝑒_1𝐾)𝐾^𝑛<br>$$<br>$$𝐴 = 𝐴_0 + 𝑒_1𝐾\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 𝑛 = 𝑒_2𝑓(𝐾, 𝐴) = 𝑒_2𝑓(𝐾,𝐴_0+𝑒_1𝐾)<br>$$<br>&emsp;Among them, 𝑄 stands for quality, 𝐴 stands for ability, 𝐴<sub>0</sub> is the ability constant. 𝑒<sub>1</sub>(efficiency) stands for knowledge ability efficiency coefficient. 𝐾 stands for knowledge. 𝑛(nature) stands for diathesis, 𝑒<sub>2</sub> stands for knowledge ability diathesis efficiency coefficient. </p>
<h3 id="Analysis-of-Model-Parameters"><a href="#Analysis-of-Model-Parameters" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of Model Parameters"></a>Analysis of Model Parameters</h3><ol>
<li><b>Parameter characteristics</b><br>𝐴<sub>0</sub> is a non-negative number.This is because any normal person has the most basic ability to survive, think and communicate.<br>𝑒<sub>1</sub> and 𝑒<sub>2</sub> are both small and relatively stable.<br>𝑒<sub>1 </sub>is positive number, but 𝑒<sub>2</sub> is rational number.</li>
<li><b>Calculation of model parameters</b><br><b>Firstly , </b>𝐴<sub>0</sub> and 𝑒<sub>1</sub>‘s default values are 1 and 0.1 respectively.<br><b>Next , </b>we should know the number of bachelor, master and doctorate students in a certain country as a percentage of the country’s total. And name them 𝑥<sub>1</sub>, 𝑥<sub>2</sub>, 𝑥<sub>3</sub>. More importantly, the age of the selected population should be kept between 25 and 64 years old. This helps to exclude some special populations(the people who have forgotten what they learned because of their ages and the people who are so smart that enter higher education at an early age), thus making the results more general. According to this, 𝐾 = 0.1𝑥<sub>1 </sub>+ 0.3𝑥<sub>2</sub> + 0.6𝑥<sub>3</sub>.<br><b>What’s more , </b>the calculation method of 𝑛 is dividing the number of bachelor degree and above in a country by it in the world.<br><b>Finally , </b>we can calculate the final result.</li>
<li><b>Dynamic changes of parameters</b><br>To 𝑄 = 𝐴𝐾<sup>𝑛</sup>, we take the first derivative and the second derivative of 𝐾 at both ends.<br>$$<br>\frac{dQ}{dK} = nAK^{n-1} \text{,} \frac{d^2Q}{dK^2} = n(n-1)AK^{n-2}<br>$$<br>&emsp;while $𝑒_2 &gt; 0$ , 𝑛 &gt; 0, $\frac{dQ}{dK} &gt; 0$. So, 𝑄 is the increasing function of 𝐾.<center>

<p>&emsp;According to this piecewise function,it is not difficult for us to find that when 𝑛 &gt; 0, the development of citizens is conducive to the development of the country.If 𝑛 &gt; 1, the increase rate of 𝑄 increment is greater than the increase rate of 𝐾 increment(see Figure 2(a)).Such people have great development potential and stamina. So countries should try to ensure their citizens’ 𝑛 &gt; 0, even 𝑛 &gt; 1.<br>&emsp;And the greater the proportion of such people in the countrys total population, the healthier the countrys higher education system.</p>
<h2 id="Service-Quality-Evaluation"><a href="#Service-Quality-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Service Quality Evaluation"></a>Service Quality Evaluation</h2><p>&emsp;Higher education is a service provided by society and the state for citizens.So,a healthy higher education system must meet the needs of citizens. Therefore,the service quality with national education can be used as an important indicator of the health of the higher education system.<br>&emsp;The concept of “service quality perceived by consumer” was put forward in 1982 by Professor Christian Gronroos,a well-known Finnish marketing scientist. And he believes that service quality is a subjective category that exists in the minds of consumers. So the best way to assess service quality is to survey citizens’ satisfaction. And in order to make higher education services better meet the needs of customers, we also need to investigate the clients assessment of the status quo.</p>
<h3 id="Gap-Analysis-Model"><a href="#Gap-Analysis-Model" class="headerlink" title="Gap Analysis Model"></a>Gap Analysis Model</h3><p>&emsp;The famous American management scientist Zeithaml and others proposed “Gap Theory” as early as 1985. We used this theory to build a gap analysis model.<br>&emsp;In order to simplify the expression, in the following, we refer to consumers of higher education or service objects of higher education and higher education service personnel as customers and service personnel respectively.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/gap.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Figure 3 : Factors causing the gap">

<p>&emsp;We use the gap between the customer’s true perception of service quality and the customer’s expectation of service quality to measure service quality.When investigating customer opinions on the service, we refer to QS ranking data. From the picture above we can see that this gap mainly comes from three aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the service staff understand the customer’s needs or not</li>
<li>Whether the service personnel comply with the regulations or not</li>
<li>Other social background factors</li>
</ul>
<p>&emsp;All these factors will form the result.When these factors have a negative impact,this will result in the quality of service actually received by the users is lower than the quality of service expected by the users. As a result, customer satisfaction with the service will decrease. When this happens, certain evaluation scores of the national higher education system will drop.</p>
<h2 id="Select-Countries-for-Analysis"><a href="#Select-Countries-for-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Select Countries for Analysis"></a>Select Countries for Analysis</h2><h3 id="Standardized-Processing"><a href="#Standardized-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Standardized Processing"></a>Standardized Processing</h3><p>&emsp; First, we standardize the original data.We use 𝑥<sub>1 </sub>, 𝑥<sub>2 </sub>, … , 𝑥<sub>𝑚 </sub> to stand for factor analysis indicator variables.The number of evaluation objects is 𝑛,  𝑎<sub>𝑖𝑗 </sub> means that 𝑖-th evaluation object corresponds to the value of 𝑗. Convert each indicator value 𝑎<sub>𝑖𝑗</sub> to a standardized indicator 𝑎<sub>𝑖𝑗</sub> .The resulting formula is as follows :</p>
<center>
$\tilde{a}$<sub>ij</sub>=$\frac{a_{i j}-\mu_{j}}{s_{j}},$ $(i=1,2, \cdots, n\ \text{;}\ j=1,2, \cdots, m)$
</center>

<p>&emsp;In this formula:<br>$$\mu_{j}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i j}\ \text{,} \ s_{j}=\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(a_{i j}-\mu_{j}\right)^{2}$$ </p>
<p>&emsp;Correspondingly, the standardized indicator variable is:<br>$$<br>    \tilde{x}_j=\frac{x_j-\mu_j}{s_j}\ ,(j=1,2, \cdots, m)<br>$$</p>
<p>&emsp;After data standardization,we got a matrix to reflect the actual situation.The resulting matrix is as follows: </p>

Among them,the characteristic roots of the first two factors are greater than 1 and their cumulative contribution rate is 100%.<br>&emsp;As shown in the Table 3,they have strong representation.

<h3 id="Specific-Selection-Process"><a href="#Specific-Selection-Process" class="headerlink" title="Specific Selection Process"></a>Specific Selection Process</h3><p>&emsp;We select countries with large regional cultural differences and representative higher education systems: the United States,China and Japan for model application evaluation.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/gap2.png" width="45%" height="50%" alt="Relevant data for evaluation">
<img src="/img/美赛图片/gap1.png" width="45%" height="50%" alt="Comprehensive data for three countries">

<p>&emsp;It can be seen from Table 6 that the United States and Japan are close in strength in the comprehensive assessment, while China’s performance is far behind. Obviously, China has big problems and hidden dangers in the field of education.Based on this, we need to conduct further analysis.</p>
<p><b>1. Investment</b></p>
<p>&emsp;In this regard, the scores of the three countries are very close,but there are still differences. Sort by score from high to low,the first place is the United States. In the United States, most high-quality educational resources are usually concentrated in private schools.High-class people have a lot of capital, which drives investment in education. The next is China.China’s ability to maintain a certain level of higher education investment comes from the support of its policies and strategies, such as “Strategy of Invigorating China Through Science and Education” and “Strengthening the Nation through Human Resource Development”. However,for Japan,due to demographic changes,it may be forced to reduce investment in education.</p>
<p><b>2. Satisfaction </b></p>
<p>&emsp;Its score ranking list is the same as Investment.The high level of higher education in the United States is obvious to all, and the actual services received by students in this country are close to their expectations. Turn to Japan,they have fewer higher education institutions, and the gap between different institutions is too large. This will greatly reduce the satisfaction of students and society with their higher education system.</p>
<p><b>3. Quality </b></p>
<p>&emsp;China’s higher education talent training quality score is as low as 3.74. This is only about 33.72% of the scores of the other two countries. It shows that Chinas talent training system is not sound. We need to make a reasonable summary of the causes of this problem in China. </p>
<p><b>(1)</b> China’s regional development is not balanced, and the development of higher education groups is not balanced. In terms of higher education enrollment rate and higher education level,there are big differences between regions and groups. For example, between areas close to Southeast Asia and West Asia and cities with special functions such as Beĳing and Shanghai,between city and countryside,between the normal and the disabled.</p>
<p><b>(2)</b> Chinese education is more purposeful. It emphasizes the cultivation of cultural literacy but ignores the cultivation of moral literacy. Most of their students are just studying to get a diploma, which will help them get better jobs in the future,and they dont particularly care about the development of scientific research capabilities.Therefore, China lacks stamina in cultivating high-end talents such as masters and doctoral students.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/漫画.jpg" width="45%" height="50%" alt="Figure 5 : Students' thinking differences">

<p>The second, third and fourth classmates of the above comic are from China, Japan and the United States respectively. This shows the different ways of thinking of students in these three countries when facing problems, and can reflect the differences in the education systems of these three countries to a certain extent.</p>
<p><b>(3)</b> The abilities of the students cultivated by Chinese universities cannot meet the needs of the industrial structure.These students have a weak sense of innovation.</p>
<p><b>(4)</b>Although China’s economic investment in education accounts for a large proportion, its population base is too large.This leads to the fact that the actual development funds received by higher education institutions are far from enough.</p>
<p>&emsp;In summary, given that China’s higher education system is the weakest and there is greater room for improvement,so we choose China as the object of further research. We will propose a revolutionary plan for China’s education field.</p>
<h1 id="TASK-2-Improvement-Strategy"><a href="#TASK-2-Improvement-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="TASK 2 : Improvement Strategy"></a>TASK 2 : Improvement Strategy</h1><h2 id="Reasonable-and-Feasible-Vision"><a href="#Reasonable-and-Feasible-Vision" class="headerlink" title="Reasonable and Feasible Vision"></a>Reasonable and Feasible Vision</h2><p>&emsp;In view of the current problems in China’s higher education system, we decided to improve in three aspects.<br><b>1. Economic input</b><br>&emsp;Increase total education expenditure from 4% to at least 5%. The proportion of higher education investment remains at the current 32%. This can be improved appropriately, but it should be controlled within 40%, so as not to reduce the education funding of primary and secondary schools.<br><b>2. Educational process</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the enrollment rate of higher education by increasing the number of enrollment and increasing the number of schools, making it increase from the current 40% to 50% or higher.</li>
<li>Increase the number of masters and doctors by expanding the scale of graduate enrollment. Doing so can increase the proportion of master’s and doctoral degrees to 8% and 1% and above respectively.</li>
<li>Pay more attention to improving students’ practical ability in talent education.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Teaching system</b><br>&emsp;Through the reform of the teaching system, we will find a more suitable teaching method for China, so as to enhance the strength of institutions and make China and Chinese institutions higher in the world rankings. Finally, make China’s higher education level meet people’s expectations. That is to make its $𝑥_3$ higher than 1.</p>
<h2 id="Target-Strategy-and-Timetable"><a href="#Target-Strategy-and-Timetable" class="headerlink" title="Target Strategy and Timetable"></a>Target Strategy and Timetable</h2><p>&emsp;In order to help China build a healthy and sustainable higher education system, we have specifically proposed the following policies :<br><b>1.</b> Promote the diversification of the higher education structure by increasing the number of public education, private education, community colleges, vocational education and other institutions.Promote the diversification of the higher education structure by increasing the number of public education, private education, community colleges, vocational education and other institutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking into account the economic situation, in the next five years, establish 10 pilot universities in coastal cities with higher economic levels such as Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen.</li>
<li>From 2026 to 2031, pilot universities will be established in central and western cities such as Xi’an, Wuhan and Jinan, where economic development levels are average.</li>
<li>Implement reforms in Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other underdeveloped regions from 2031 to 2036. In the reform, the overall development should be promoted through the partial areas, and the pilot institutions should promote the development of the surrounding areas.</li>
<li>Encourage capable colleges and universities to run schools in different places. Especially universities and universities with limited development space due to poor inland areas and geographical locations can choose cities with better geographical locations to establish branch schools and graduate schools. This can create new vitality for the local area and its development.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. </b>Further improve the diversified pattern of funding sources for higher education. In order to achieve the goal of ensuring that schools have sufficient funds to carry out education and teaching activities, China should learn from the experience of the world and proceed from its own reality. It can be considered from these aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vigorously develop private universities in accordance with the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Promoting Non-public Education. Let private universities account for more than 30%, and expanding the total amount of funding for higher education in China.</li>
<li>Make it clear that the government is the main channel of funding for higher education and increase the proportion of fiscal education expenditure to GDP to over 5% within five years.</li>
<li>Encourage personal donations to fund the learning of poor students and increase the proportion of donation income. For example, enact laws and regulations to enable donors to obtain financial and reputational returns.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. </b>Introduce a new higher education talent training program within 5 years. Its focus is to cultivate students’ innovative spirit and practical ability. Implement the plan for 5 years, and make continuous improvements according to the results during the implementation process. Only in this way can students truly and effectively transform knowledge into abilities.</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Cultivate a team of high-quality teachers and conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the<br>quality of teachers. This is because the quality of teaching staff will greatly affect the quality of students. At the same time, in order to make more people willing to devote themselves to education, we should raise the salary and social status of teachers. The most direct and effective way is to increase financial investment in this area. Within three years, we will increase the overall salary of teachers by 10%.</p>
<p><b>5. </b>China will continue to reform its teaching system in the next ten years to find a more suitable teaching system for China. Doing so will help strengthen the strength of the institution and make China and Chinese institutions higher in the world rankings. When China’s higher education approaches or even meets people’s expectations, the education reform is successful.</p>
<p><b>The implementation timeline is below. Please look at Figure 6 .</b></p>

In order to better compare the situation before and after the improvement, we drew the picture below.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/confrontation.PNG" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Figure 7 : Vision vs Status quo">

<p>&emsp;From Figure 7, we can see that China’s various indicators have risen. All indicators in China currently account for more than 50% of the total value of indicators. Among them, the rise of $𝑥_1$ is the most significant.</p>
<p>&emsp;And China’s comprehensive evaluation score on the higher education system has greatly improved. It has risen from 1.95 to 4.92 . This is about 2.52 times the previous. It directly proves that our policy is effective.</p>

<h2 id="Effect-Evaluation"><a href="#Effect-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Effect Evaluation"></a>Effect Evaluation</h2><p>&emsp;In order to better understand the effects of our policies and make improvements in the future, we have conducted a more in-depth analysis of their effects. In this process, we established the CIPP model.</p>
<p>&emsp;The CIPP evaluation model is a decision-centered education evaluation model proposed by the American educator Stufflebeam in 1967. As for education evaluation, American educators describe it as “a systematic survey of educational goals and their strengths, weaknesses and values”. Now, the cipp evaluation model is widely used in the field of evaluating educational effects. It can provide information for our educational decisions.</p>

<h3 id="Construction-of-CIPP-Model"><a href="#Construction-of-CIPP-Model" class="headerlink" title="Construction of CIPP Model"></a>Construction of CIPP Model</h3><p>&emsp;The CIPP evaluation model is mainly divided into four parts: context, input,process and product.</p>

<li>Higher education development positioning<br>The development direction of higher education should adapt to practical teaching and promote the improvement of students practical ability.

Therefore, we should constantly update the system to meet this demand.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Specific-Evaluation-of-Policy-Implementation-Effect"><a href="#Specific-Evaluation-of-Policy-Implementation-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Specific Evaluation of Policy Implementation Effect"></a>Specific Evaluation of Policy Implementation Effect</h3><p>&emsp;In our policy effect evaluation process,the evaluation of the results of the first-level indicators reflects the more optimistic prospects of the Chinese education system on 𝑥1. At the same time, the original talent assessment methods and content have been greatly improved. This lays the foundation for higher-level master and doctoral students to have higher scientific research capabilities. Moreover, the students personal ability, quality, and knowledge integrity are significantly improved.<br>&emsp;In the evaluation of secondary indicators,China has increased the share of education investment in GDP. This has better compensation in terms of expanding the assets owned by the university and bringing in teachers. At the same time, the improvement of the teaching staff also benefits from important economic projects.<br>&emsp;In addition, because Chinese citizens have a high level of original satisfaction with Chinese education, during the three-level indicator evaluation process, we found that although the new policy has a certain promotion effect on the regulatory level, the overall level is basically maintained at the original high level.<br>&emsp;<b>In summary, </b>after the implementation of the new policy,China has improved its scores in terms of talent quality, GDP investment and satisfaction. The score for the most improved area increased by 50%. And even the score for the least improved aspect also increased by 1.2%. Under the comprehensive influence of various factors, the final comprehensive score of the model increased by about 47.2%. At the same time, in view of the differences between regions in real life, our policy includes formulating a clear layout plan to promote the development of higher education in terms of time and city. Not only that, our team also considered the impact of natural disasters due to uncertain factors. This all shows that our policy has strong robustness and operability.</p>
<h1 id="TASK-4-Influencing-Factors-in-the-Real-World"><a href="#TASK-4-Influencing-Factors-in-the-Real-World" class="headerlink" title="TASK 4:Influencing Factors in the Real World"></a>TASK 4:Influencing Factors in the Real World</h1><p>&emsp;We want to study and visualize the impact of the policy in different regions.So we drew a map and used shades of color to indicate the degree of policy influence in the region.<br>&emsp;In this figure, the darker the color, the greater the impact of the policy on the area. Conversely, the lighter the color, the less impact the policy will have on the area.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/地图map.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Figure 9 : Policy Impact">

<p>&emsp;After careful observation and analysis, we found that the policy has the greatest impact on the central and western regions of China. The previous level of development in these areas was relatively average and we have also formulated a reasonable development plan based on its actual situation. The results obtained so far show that our policy is very reasonable for their handling.<br>&emsp;But analyzing the backward areas in the northwest and southwest, the policy has little impact on it. The main reason is that their geographical location is too remote, all aspects are underdeveloped, and the masses are not very open-minded. So,if we want to improve our policies, we can start from this aspect. The best way is to formulate specific local policies based on local actual conditions. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to change it in a short time. Therefore, we still need to spend a lot of time and energy to better implement the policy. And in the process of policy implementation, there are many practical factors that will prevent us from achieving the expected implementation results.</p>
<h2 id="Impact-on-the-Education-System"><a href="#Impact-on-the-Education-System" class="headerlink" title="Impact on the Education System"></a>Impact on the Education System</h2><p>&emsp;We want to compare the development trend of citizens’ cultural level in these two situations (before and after the policy change), so we used the model proposed by the IIASA Association to quantitatively analyze the number of citizens of different cultural levels. The specific calculation principle of the model is as follows:</p>
<p>$$<br>N(\text { age }-5, \text { educ, } t-5, \mathrm{sex})=\frac{N(\text { age }, \text { educ }, t, \mathrm{sex})}{S R(\text { age }-5, \text { educ }, t-5, \operatorname{sex})}<br>$$</p>
<p>&emsp;In this formula, 𝑁 represents the number of people in the group defined by age, education level and gender. 𝑆𝑅 is survival rate,it takes into account both mortality and immigration. The model illustrates the dependence of survival on education.<br>&emsp;But this formula uses the survival rate to trace a period (5 years). So we can’t use it directly.Therefore,we fine-tuned it then used it to trace the next 30 years.<br>&emsp;Based on this, we drew Figure 10.</p>

Figure 10: Educated population change forecast map
</center>

<p>&emsp;It can be seen from this figure that in this forecast, the overall cultural quality of Chinese citizens has improved after the implementation of the new policy. Among Chinese citizens, the number of people receiving higher education has increased. It is noteworthy that this increase is not very significant, because higher education requires personal talent, hard work and family financial support.<br>&emsp;But this situation will be better improved in the longer future. This view can also be proved by this graph. In Chinas education system, most students have lower education levels than higher education, and only a very small number of students can receive higher education. But we need to know that to receive higher education, we must first accumulate certain knowledge.So the increase in the number of students receiving primary and secondary education will help increase the number of students receiving higher education.<br>&emsp;Because our policy is not only aimed at higher education, but also involves all levels of education, it has positive significance for both primary and secondary education. This produces the result shown in the figure.</p>
<h2 id="Impact-on-Society-and-the-Country"><a href="#Impact-on-Society-and-the-Country" class="headerlink" title="Impact on Society and the Country"></a>Impact on Society and the Country</h2><p>&emsp;<b>1. </b>In today’s rapid development of science and technology, the expansion of high-level talents is the cornerstone of national development. Our policy is closely aligned with the times and satisfies this demand well. The direct effect of it is to increase the number of people receiving higher education. It has great benefits in terms of economy and technology. This accelerates the future development of the country.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>2. </b>. Our policy has stimulated progress in backward areas. This helps alleviate Chinas uneven development. Some underdeveloped regions are not without development potential, but due to geographical reasons, they have not received attention. Our policies have changed this situation and provided strong support to these areas so that they can fully exploit their potential.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>3. </b>As our policy strengthens the supervision of teaching management personnel, on the basis of increasing education investment, more education investment can be better used in the teaching process. At the same time, it helps to establish discipline and prevent some corruption.</p>
<p>&emsp;<b>4. </b>Our policy advocates the principle of combining learning knowledge with practice, and encourages scientific research, development and innovation. This creates a good learning atmosphere. The whole people explore science and development together, and society and the country will get better and better.</p>
<h1 id="Sensitivity-Analysis"><a href="#Sensitivity-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Sensitivity Analysis"></a>Sensitivity Analysis</h1><p>&emsp;In the talent quality evaluation model, we calculate the value of 𝑛 by dividing the proportion of the number of people with a bachelor’s degree or above in a country by the proportion of the number of people with a bachelor’s degree or above in the world. For the convenience of expression, here we use 𝑀 to represent the proportion of bachelor degree and above in the world. In fact, M is not a constant value, so we let 𝑀 change, and then observe the changes in the results to explore the sensitivity of the model.</p>
<p>&emsp;As we all know that $Q=AK^n$, $n=\frac{\LARGE{x_1}}{M}$. And the functional relationship between F and Q can be abbreviated as $F=aQ+b$. So, we can get the formula that $Q=AK^{\frac{\LARGE {x_1}}{M}}$. </p>
<p>&emsp;We find the first derivative of $Q$:</p>

<p>&emsp;And $F$ and $M$ have a similar relationship,so we can consider that:<br>$$F=a AK^{\frac{x_1}{M}}+b\ \ \ \ \ \ F’=\frac{dF}{dM}=\frac{dF}{dQ}\frac{dQ}{dM}=a\frac{dQ}{dM}=aQ’$$</p>

<p>&emsp;As shown in the this figure, when 𝑀 changes,𝑄 and 𝐹 do not change much. Whenever 𝑀 increases by 0.05, 𝑄 and 𝐹 will not change more than 10% . This has the same meaning as shown in the figure below.</p>
<img src="/img/美赛图片/灵敏度1.png" width="60%" height="60%" alt="">

<p>&emsp;And the values of 𝑄′ and 𝐹′ are very close to 0, which indicates that the change of 𝑀 has little effect on 𝑄 and 𝐹. At the same time, considering that the proportion of the number of people with bachelor and above degrees in the world is unlikely to change dramatically in a short period of time, we finally believe that our model is stable.</p>
<h1 id="Strengths-and-Weaknesses"><a href="#Strengths-and-Weaknesses" class="headerlink" title="Strengths and Weaknesses"></a>Strengths and Weaknesses</h1><h2 id="Strengths"><a href="#Strengths" class="headerlink" title="Strengths"></a>Strengths</h2><ul>
<li>The data on which we build the model and the predictions come from official websites and official journals, which are more rigorous.</li>
<li>Our model fully takes into account the national power gaps between different countries, and balances the impact of the economic differences between developing countries and developing countries on the evaluation of education by introducing a satisfaction model, so it has strong applicability and universality.</li>
<li>Our model can track the health of higher education in a country for a long time, and evaluate the health of higher education at any point in time.</li>
<li>When the actual situation changes, the parameter index of the factors of the model can be adjusted to adapt to the new environment, which is flexible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Weakness"><a href="#Weakness" class="headerlink" title="Weakness"></a>Weakness</h2><ul>
<li>• In order to simplify the model and facilitate calculations, we assume that religion, race, gender, etc. have no influence, but the higher education of the actual country is often affected by these factors.</li>
<li>When establishing the talent quality evaluation model, we believe that all of the individuals knowledge and abilities come from the national education system,but in reality the level of knowledge of the human group will also come from the family society.</li>
